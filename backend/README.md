# MindEase – OCD Tracker & AI Companion
**This is an open-source project. Please contribute to help improve the lives of people who are living with OCD.**

MindEase is a calm, privacy-focused web application designed to help users understand their OCD patterns through daily check-ins, journaling, progress tracking, and supportive AI-based guidance. It aims to provide a gentle, safe space where people can reflect on their thoughts, identify triggers, notice patterns, and feel more in control.  
This is not a medical tool—just a compassionate companion for awareness.
